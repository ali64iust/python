Note: The file will be written in the root directory (/) because the program will write in the path from the perspective of systemd. To change that simply edit out the file path. For example:
import time
from datetime import datetime
path_to_file = "enter the desired path of the file"
while True:
    with open(path_to_file, "a") as f:
        f.write("The current timestamp is: " + str(datetime.now()))
        f.close()
    time.sleep(10)
